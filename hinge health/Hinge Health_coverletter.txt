Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Healthcare Data Analyst position at Hinge Health in San Francisco, California. With a strong educational background in Data Science, including coursework in Statistics and Data Analysis, and hands-on experience as a Data Scientist at UCSF Radiology/Oncology Cancer Research, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.

During my internship, I fine-tuned a BERT model to predict hospital readmissions based on doctor notes, achieving an impressive ROC AUC score of 0.71. Additionally, I utilized LLMs for literature mining to expand the PhosphoAtlas database, integrating diverse sources to simulate protein-protein interactions using graph neural networks (GNNs). These experiences have equipped me with the skills to identify therapeutically actionable kinase networks, contributing to the development of targeted cancer therapies.

In my role as a Lung Cancer RNA Sequencing Analyst at the University of California, Irvine, I cleaned and visualized large datasets using techniques such as violin plots, PCA, and k-means clustering. Through this work, I discovered different cells lung carcinoma differentiates into and identified how these cells communicate with one another through cell signaling pathways.

Furthermore, my project experience, such as developing an ETL pipeline to identify undervalued stocks based on key financial metrics and designing a schema for a football SQL database project, showcases my proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity at Hinge Health because of the company's innovative approach to healthcare and commitment to improving patient outcomes. I am eager to bring my analytical skills, statistical knowledge, and passion for data-driven insights to contribute to the impactful work being done at Hinge Health.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasm align with the needs of your team. Please feel free to contact me at [Email] or [Phone] to schedule a meeting.

Warm regards,

Lukas Amare
